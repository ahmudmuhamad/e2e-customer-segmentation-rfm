# **e2e-RFM-based Customer Segmentation**

An end-to-end machine learning system to cluster e-commerce customers using RFM analysis and deploy the model as a real-time, containerized FastAPI application.

## **1\. Introduction**

This project moves beyond a simple analysis notebook to a production-ready, MLOps-focused system. It takes raw e-commerce transaction data, engineers RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) features, trains a K-Means clustering model, and deploys this model as a high-performance API.

The entire workflow is automated with a Makefile, the API is containerized with Docker, and the project is fully documented with MkDocs.

## **2\. The Four Customer Segments**

The model groups customers into four distinct segments, allowing for targeted and effective marketing strategies:

* **🥇 Champions:** Your best and most loyal customers. They buy recently, frequently, and spend the most.  
  * **Strategy:** Reward them with loyalty programs, early access, and personalized engagement. Avoid discounts.  
* **⚠️ At-Risk:** High-value customers who *used* to buy frequently but haven't purchased in a while.  
  * **Strategy:** High-priority. Win them back with personalized re-engagement emails and special discounts.  
* **🆕 New Customers:** First-time or recent buyers with low frequency.  
  * **Strategy:** Nurture them. Send a welcome series and offer incentives for a second purchase to build frequency.  
* **📉 Lost Customers:** Customers with high recency (long time since last purchase) and low frequency/monetary value.  
  * **Strategy:** Low-priority. Include in a low-cost win-back newsletter, but do not spend significant marketing budget.

--------

## **5\. Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

* Python (3.12+)  
* uv (or pip)  
* make (On Windows, install with winget install Gnu.Make)  
* Docker Desktop (Optional, for running the container)

### **Setup & Installation**

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```
   git clone https://github.com/ahmudmuhamad/e2e-customer-segmentation-rfm.git
   cd e2e-customer-segmentation-rfm
   ```


3. **Create and activate the environment:**
   ``` 
   \# Create the .venv  
   make create\_environment

   \# Activate (Windows)  
   .venv\\Scripts\\activate

   \# Activate (macOS / Linux)  
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

5. **Install dependencies:**  
    ```
   make requirements
    ```

## **6\. How to Use**

You can run this project as an automated pipeline, a live API server, or a Docker container.

### **Option 1: Run the Automated Pipeline**

This is the simplest way to run the project. It will process all data and train the models from scratch.

\# This command runs data, train, and predict steps in order  
make all

This will:

1. **data:** Run src/features.py to create data/processed/rfm\_features.csv.  
2. **train:** Run src/modeling/train.py to create models/scaler.pkl and models/kmeans\_model.pkl.  
3. **predict:** Run src/modeling/predict.py to create the final data/processed/customer\_segments.csv.

To clean up all generated files, run make clean.

### **Option 2: Run the Real-Time API**

After running make all (which creates the model files), you can start the API server.

1. **Start the server:**
   ```
   uvicorn app:app \--reload
   ```

3. Access the Docs:  
   Open your browser to
    ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.
    ``` 
5. Send a Request:  
   Use the interactive docs or curl to send a POST request:  
    ```
   curl \-X POST "\[http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/segment\](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/segment)" \\  
   \-H "Content-Type: application/json" \\  
   \-d '{  
         "recency": 15,  
         "frequency": 2,  
         "monetary": 350.75  
       }'
    ```
    ```
   **Response:**  
   {  
     "segment\_name": "New Customers",  
     "cluster\_label": 2  
   }
    ```
### **Option 3: Run with Docker**

This is the recommended way to run the API in a production-like environment.

1. **Build the image:**
   ```
   docker build \-t rfm-api .
   ```

3. **Run the container:**
   ```
   docker run \-p 8000:8000 \--name rfm-service rfm-api
   ```

   The API is now running and accessible at
    ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.
    ```
